### EXPLANATION 

#### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES 

- Word Tokenization: Converts the text into a sequence of integers.
- Padding: Ensures all sequences have equal lengths.
- Embedding Layer: Encodes words into dense vectors for the model.
- LSTM Layers: Captures temporal dependencies and context.
- Dense Output Layer: Predicts the next word based on probabilities.

#### PROJECT WORKFLOW 
=== "Step 1"
Initial data exploration and understanding:
- Load the dataset and understand its structure.
- Explore the text corpus for word frequency, sentence structure, and vocabulary size.

=== "Step 2"
Data cleaning and preprocessing:
- Remove punctuation and convert text to lowercase.
- Tokenize text into sequences and pad them to uniform length.

=== "Step 3"
Feature engineering and selection:
- Use word embeddings to create dense feature representations.

=== "Step 4"
Model training and evaluation:
- Build an LSTM-based sequential model.
- Train on input-output sequences derived from the dataset.
- Use categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

=== "Step 5"\
Model optimization and fine-tuning:
- Adjust hyperparameters like embedding size, LSTM units, and learning rate.

=== "Step 6"
Validation and testing:
- Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its performance.
- Generate text sequences using a seed sentence.

#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Trade-Off 1"
- Accuracy vs. Training Time:
- Solution: Balanced by reducing the model's complexity and using an efficient optimizer.

=== "Trade-Off 2"
- Model complexity vs. Overfitting:
- Solution: Implemented dropout layers and monitored validation loss during training.
